## Visualizing data in Python with Altair

This is a introductory-level workshop given through Duke University's 
[Data and Visualization Services](https://library.duke.edu/data) on how to use
[Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) to visualize data within 
[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

There is a [recording of the session](https://library.capture.duke.edu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=a4ff4635-fdcf-4006-ae19-a9d100ed1206),
and you can download [a PDF of the slides]() from the lecture portion.

I also have a [recording of a previous workshop](https://library.capture.duke.edu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d8a3efe2-48d7-4505-acd3-a943013c2442)
on *Tidy Data in Python with JupyterLab*, which might be good to watch before this one
if you're not familiar with JupyterLab or manipulating tabular data with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

In both workshops I recommend using the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). 
You'll still have to install Altair afterwards, though, by typing 
in a terminal window (Mac) or the Anaconda Prompt (Windows):

``` bash
conda install -c conda-forge altair
```

Neither workshop teach the basics of the Python programming language, and it's probably
helpful to have seen some Python before this if you're going to make any sense out of the 
material. But, you don't have to be very advanced to learn something from these videos!
